416. Partition Equal Subset Sum My SubmissionsBack To Contest
Given a non-empty array containing only positive integers, find if the
array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.

Note:
Both the array size and each of the array element will not exceed 100.

Example 1:

Input: [1, 5, 11, 5]

Output: true

Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].
Example 2:

Input: [1, 2, 3, 5]

Output: false

Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.
